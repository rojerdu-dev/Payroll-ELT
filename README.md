# Payroll-ELT 
This project is a Snowflake Extract, Load, & Transform (ELT) project using payroll data from [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e) for the current fiscal year. 

The project aims to answer 2 questions about NYC's payroll data: 
* What borough gets paid the most?
* What are the top 5 most compensated professions in NYC?
